# Data Analysis relating EVs with different factors

This is a data analysis project which helps establish relationship between EVs and multiple different factors.

For this project,I have compared number of EVs sold with respect to Range (Kilometer/Full Charge),Price Range(INR),Capacity and Boot-Space.

The model will employ statistical techniques, identify key variables impacting EV growth.

From the data,the number of sales of EVs depend upon various factors but the most important factor affecting EV sales is the price of EVs.

The model is written in R language.

Feel free to suggest any extra functionality.
